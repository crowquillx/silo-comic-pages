# Silo Comic Pages

A Silo plugin that extracts CBR/RAR and CBZ/ZIP archives on the server and
serves individual comic pages. It is designed for
[the Silo Aidoku source](https://github.com/crowquillx/aidoku-silo-sources).
No Silo or Aidoku app changes are required.

The plugin uses the reader's existing Silo credentials to fetch the archive
through Silo's ebook API. It needs no media filesystem mappings, administrator
API key, proprietary `unrar` executable, or separate HTTP port.

## Install

Download the binary for your Silo server from
[Releases](https://github.com/crowquillx/silo-comic-pages/releases).
Linux amd64 and Linux arm64 builds are published with SHA-256
checksums and license notices.

In Silo, open **Administration → Plugins** and upload the binary. Alternatively,
add this repository index to the plugin catalog and install Comic Pages:

```text
https://github.com/crowquillx/silo-comic-pages/releases/latest/download/repository.json
```

Configure the plugin with a Silo API base URL reachable from its process and a
dedicated writable cache directory. For a plugin running inside the Silo
container, the base URL can be `http://127.0.0.1:8090`. Use a dedicated cache
directory with enough free disk space. Cached pages are discarded when the
plugin starts or reconfigures. Do not use a media library directory as the cache
directory.

Use a separate cache directory for each installation. The plugin rejects
nonempty directories it does not own and locks its cache against concurrent
use. Before downloading, it checks that the cache budget has room for the maximum
archive plus maximum extracted bytes: 1.5 GiB with the defaults. Files consume
space only as bytes are downloaded or extracted. If you lower the cache limit
below that sum, lower the corresponding archive or extraction limit too.

Update the Aidoku Silo source to v11 or newer. It finds the plugin through the
**Comic Pages** entry this plugin adds to Silo's user sidebar, so there is
nothing to paste. That entry opens a short setup page. CBR chapters then use the
plugin, and CBZ chapters keep Aidoku's existing ZIP range reader. To use the
built-in CBR decoder instead, turn off **Reading → Use Comic Pages plugin** in
the source settings.

Sources v5 to v10 need the installation ID from Silo's Installed tab in
**Reading → Comic Pages plugin installation ID**. This is the installation ID,
not the plugin ID `dev.crowquillx.comic-pages`. Auto-detection needs Silo's v2
API; on v1 servers, enter the installation ID.

## How reading works

1. Aidoku sends the chapter and file IDs, current token, and selected profile
   in an authenticated POST body to the plugin route on the same Silo server.
2. The plugin checks the caller against Silo and checks access to that chapter
   and file. It downloads and extracts an uncached archive in a background job.
3. Aidoku receives a naturally sorted page list. Each page request checks access
   again before returning bytes from the extraction cache.

The first chapter open can take longer while extraction runs. Requests report
that work is in progress instead of holding Silo's 10-second plugin call open.
Aidoku polls for completion. Large images arrive in 1 MiB chunks because plugin
responses are buffered through gRPC. Aidoku joins them without recompression.

Tokens are sent in POST bodies, never in page URLs. They are not written into
the extraction cache. The configured Silo server is the only archive origin;
clients cannot supply arbitrary URLs or filesystem paths. Cached images remain
subject to Silo access checks. Restarting the plugin or eviction can invalidate
an open chapter; reopen it to prepare a fresh page list.

## Disk usage and automatic cleanup

Version 0.1.1 defaults to a **2 GiB cache budget**, covering both cached images
and temporary extraction data. Old chapters are evicted when a new job needs
space. `max_cache_bytes` can set a different budget up to 4 GiB. An explicit
value saved in an existing installation takes precedence over the new default.

Downloaded archive copies and partial extraction files are removed when a job
finishes or fails. Completed pages expire after **30 minutes without access**,
with cleanup every minute even when no requests arrive. Active page reads keep
their files until the read finishes. Silo's original comic files are unchanged.

Graceful shutdown and reconfiguration clear the cache. After a crash, forced
kill, or power loss, the next startup removes leftover jobs and pages before
accepting new work. A stopped process cannot run cleanup; if you permanently
uninstall it after a forced stop, remove its dedicated cache directory too.

Deletion failures keep their disk budget charged and are retried. New extraction
can return `cache_full` while undeletable data occupies the budget. Filesystem
metadata and block rounding add some overhead beyond the file-byte budget.
The plugin executable is about 15 MB and is separate from this cache budget.

## Limits

| Resource | Default / maximum |
| --- | --- |
| Compressed archive | 512 MiB |
| Decoded entry or image | 32 MiB |
| Decoded image pixels | 67,108,864 |
| Decoded bytes across all entries | 1 GiB |
| Archive entries | 2,048 |
| RAR dictionary window | 64 MiB |
| Extraction cache | 2 GiB / 4 GiB |
| Concurrent extraction jobs | 1 |
| Download and extraction job deadline | 120 seconds |
| Page response chunk | 1 MiB |

The connection settings accept lower byte and entry limits. Each extraction
runs in a child process that the plugin can terminate. The child receives a
2 GiB virtual-address-space limit and has core dumps disabled. These limits
do not describe a fixed RSS budget. In particular, the RAR4 PPMd decoder can
allocate a model beyond its dictionary-window setting. The initial release
supports Linux because this process limit has been implemented there.

Supported page formats are PNG, JPEG, GIF, and static WebP. Animated WebP,
encrypted archives, split archives, and filesystem links return errors. ZIP64
end-of-directory records are unsupported; small ZIP archives containing ZIP64
entry extras are accepted. Original archive files are never modified.

## Development

Go 1.26 is required. The plugin is pure Go and builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.

```sh
go mod download
go test -count=1 ./...
go vet ./...
make build
bin/plugin manifest
```

`internal/archive` owns extraction and image ordering. The server and Silo API
adapter own authorization, background work, and cache lifecycle. Synthetic
RAR4/RAR5 normal and solid fixtures contain original generated PNGs; provenance
is recorded in [testdata/fixtures/README.md](testdata/fixtures/README.md).
See [the protocol](docs/protocol.md), [cleanup validation](docs/cache-cleanup.md),
and [initial release validation](docs/validation.md)
for the request contract, measured artifacts, and test coverage.
